My final project focuses on creating a user-friendly platform accessible to everyone, allowing you to easily locate the nearest gym worldwide by simply entering your address or the desired location.

The development required proficiency in Python, Django, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

On the main page, you can filter gyms by various activities such as nutrition, air conditioning, pilates, swimming, spinning, parking availability, and more. Furthermore, you can explore each gym in detail, viewing all available pictures.

To find the closest gym, you need to create a user account, a process that involves entering basic information: username, email, and password, followed by a registration click. Once registered and signed in, you can access the address page. Here, you input your location details - street, city, neighborhood, and state - and click the search button. Subsequently, the app will display all the nearest gyms based on your provided address.

It was necessary to utilize the Google Maps API to access both the user's location and the locations of the gyms. Additionally, the user is required to grant the browser permission to access their location before the functionality can be initiated.

For a comprehensive understanding, you can access all gym details by clicking on 'All Details'.

The idea for this project stemmed from the absence of free applications that provide comprehensive details on gyms in today's world.
